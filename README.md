# Isolation-Game-Agent

This is a command line based game of Isolation built in Java.  I used the Min-Max algorithm with Alpha Beta Search pruning with a heruistic
to create this agent.  The agent's heuristic strategy is to put itself in a position where it has more moves compared to the users.  It can
switch its play style as it sometimes plays offensively and at other times plays very defensively.
