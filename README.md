# Isolation-Game-Agent

This is a command line based game of Isolation built using Java.  I used the Min-Max algorithm with Alpha Beta Search pruning with a heruistic
to create this agent.  The agent's heuristic strategy is to put itself in a position where it has more moves compared to the users.  It can
switch its play style as it sometimes plays offensively and at other times plays very defensively.  

# How to run the program.
All you have to do is clone and compile the files in Java.  After that, just run Main.java and the prompt of the game will guide you on how to play!
